# R-Practice

First time coding in R. This is a step in my exploration of Data science.

# Overview

The purpose of this project was to explore the subject of data science. Specifically I began to learn to code in R.

The data I analyzed were the scripts for the original StarWars trilogy. They are text files with three fields: an index, character, and dialogue.

The software I wrote is an exploration of R. I learned to import data, preform mathematical operations and display graphs.

# Data Analysis Results

The question I asked was about the length of line spoken by characters. I wanted to know if lines tended to be long or short and by how much. Do certain characters deviate from the norm?

The Result is that characters tend to have the same distribution of line length. They deliver mostly short lines with decreasing numbers lines as length increased.
This held true for both good and bad characters.

# Development Environment

I used RStudio as my development environment.
Code written in R.

# Future Work

- I need much more practice in R
- I want to learn to more effectively interact with .txt files
